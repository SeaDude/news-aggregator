# News Aggregator Experiment

### How to get running

1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/SeaDude/news-aggregator.git`
2. Run `pip install > requirements.txt` to install Python necessary modules
3. Run `python .\test.py` to generate `.json` files

### What it (currently) does  

- Creates separate `.json` files of the headlines taken from major news sources.
- It does this by aggregating various RSS feeds 
- Add your own RSS feeds by adding to the `urls` variable

### What is may someday do

- I don't know!
- Whatever me and my buddy come up with!
- Probably something using data analytics and databases
